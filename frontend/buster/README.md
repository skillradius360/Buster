# Buster Frontend 🎨

The user interface for **Buster**, an AI image detector built for speed and aesthetics, handling both individual URL submissions and multi-image carousel post previews.

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js** (App/Pages router built on React)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling, animations, and the UI)
- **React Hooks** (for dynamic state routing, automatic viewport scrolling, etc)

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend/buster
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the live forensic dashboard. The frontend is fully connected to the local API endpoint (`http://localhost:8000/analyze`).
